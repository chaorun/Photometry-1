To make new script in PixInsight,
   typically found (2015) in a location such as
   C:\Program Files\PixInsight\src\scripts\AdP\AperturePhotometry.js:
   
1. Make a copy of template javascript (.js) file under new filename (preferably in same folder).
2. Make code edits as desired (Notepad++ as Administrator). 
   Also:
      Edit #feature-id to make script ID unique in PixInsight script lists.
      Edit #feature-info, which will appear in script's info boxes.
      Optionally edit #define VERSION "" which will appear in script dialog box header.
      Edit #define TITLE "" which will appear in script dialog box header.
3. In PixInsight, Script > Feature Scripts... dialog box:
      Add, select Folder holding script .js file, OK. 
	     It should respond with:
         "1 additional script file found on directory", click Done.
4. Access script via Script > [script category from #feature-id above],
      for example Script > Image Analysis > MyNewImageAnalysisScript.
