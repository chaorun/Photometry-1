TODO list: as of 20160312.

Immediate/showstopper (20160312): 
[None.]

Soon / normal development (20160312):


---------------------------
Someday development:

ANplanner.R (& FOV files before run):

Input.R (& FOV files during reduction):
* Write own CalibrationMaster & Calibrate All routines to completely replace MaxIm usage.

Model.R: 

Transform.R: 
* Rewrite this completely into Input.R, to use its normal image processing and to extract
transforms by Model.R, rather than via this separate transform-extraction workflow.

FOVs, diagnostics etc:
* Diagnostic routine to verify all FOV files for consistency, e.g., all Target FOVs lacking check star, 
missing required directives, out-of-scope values, etc.
* New directive for FOV type: Target, Standard (etc?)
