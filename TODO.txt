TODO list: as of 20151220.

Input.R:
* [someday] FOV file: new per-star notation to mark interfering stars, esp by direction (& arcsec dist?) 
(or by RA Dec). --> OR possibly this can be automated in the aperture math alone (median-of-medians?) so
that we avoid this effort to make FOV files (and avoid complicating them as well).
* [someday] Rewrite aperture math (InstMag, FWHM, Sky), then using APT only to get pixel coordinates for targets. 
This should improve interference rejection in sky annulus, FWHM values good enough to use in curating
observations, etc.
* [someday] Write own CalibrationMaster & Calibrate All routines to completely replace MaxIm usage.

Transform.R: 
* [someday] Rewrite this completely into Input.R, to use its normal image processing and to extract
transforms by Model.R, rather than via this separate transform-extraction workflow.

Model.R: 


FOVs, diagnostics etc:
* Routine to verify all FOV files for consistency, e.g., all Target FOVs lacking check star, missing
directives, etc.
* New directive for FOV type: Target, Standard (etc?)
