# Photometry
Eric Dose's R scripts etc for telescope photometry, especially for processing FITS image files and field-of-view data all the way to AAVSO reports for submission.

## My workflow
Wow, has this changed since I last updated this README. For an overview, you might want to look at the poster PDF in this repository. 

While the first, basic end-to-end workflow was complete Feb 7 2016, and tagged v 0.1, I found in April-May that I needed to rewrite the modeling data prep to accommodate the poor quality of very many comp stars in VPhot sequences (as evaluated both by large regression residuals and by widely ranging mag errors listed in the matching VSP charts). 

The workflow as committed today (May 15 2016) is between numbered versions and is NOT READY for use. Some code rewriting is done, but I still need to write and test much of the data prep and ALL of the modeling and ALL of the subsequent reporting (especially new error estimation and reporting check stars as AUIDs to resolve ambiguity).

Current working version is **V 0.51** (March 26 2016), and it works as well as it can without being more selective of comp stars to build the model. Manual comp-star selection works fairly well, but future versions will use magnitude errors reported in the corresponding AAVSO/VSP chart, both to screen comp stars in/out of the model, and to compute more realistic errors on the reported target-star magnitudes.

The V 0.51 workflow is:

**Input.R (pre-calibration)_______________________________________________**

 1. **renameObject()** --- Optional, rarely used any more. Renames FITS files *and* FITS headers' "OBJECT" value from old to new Object name, across all FITS files (and subdirectories) within AN top folder. For example, renames all "Landolt_001" to "Std_001". This was needed whenever object name and file name in images (probably due to inclusion in ACP nightly observing plan) had been poorly chosen. renameObject() must be run first if it is used at all.
 2. **checkFOVs()** --- Run next, on every data set without exception. Checks that a field-of-view FOV file exists for every FITS file. A FOV file is required for every FITS file included in the model and AAVSO reporting. FOV files are obviously not required for FITS files acquired for other uses, notably those acquired as "Burn" images to prepare new FOV files for use in future photometric runs.
 1. **beforeCal()** --- Calls all 3 functions in correct order: copyToUr(), renameACP(), and prepareForCal(), which takes renames and arranges FITS files (light, flat, bias, and darks) for the next step, which is calibration (I use MaxIm DL). Its steps in order are: [copyToUr()]: Copies (backs up) all (possibly renamed) target FITS files to a new /Ur directory, for safe keeping. [renameACP()]: Renames all _target_ FITS files (not calibration files) from ACP-format names (like TargetName-S001-R001-C003-V-dupe1.fts) to my own strictly sequential file naming system(like TargetName-0003-V.fts). Each new sequence number is based on time (JD) from the FITS header, and it is validated and sorted by time across all files of the same TargetName. Renaming is not fooled by dupe or duplicate naming across subdirectories. TargetNames and Filter IDs are verified for equality between the original file name and the FITS header. All target FITS files are then collected in the top AN folder. A table of old vs new file names is written to a text file, and the data frame is stored as a .RData file for immediate reload into R. [prepareForCal()]: Sets up folders /Calibration (all flat, dark, bias images for the AN), /CalibrationMasters (calibration images duplicated here & ultimate home of MaxIm generated calibration master frames), /Ur (backup of all renamed target FITS files; may move this forward to renameACP() (or similar fn) so that the Ur files are really Ur), and /Photometry (catchall for metadata about this AN folder).

**Calibration of all target images in MaxIm DL (not in R)______________________**

  1. Ensure all needed raw flat, dark, and bias frames are collected in /CalibrationMasters.
  1. In MaxIm, "Set Calibration" to this /CalibrationMasters folder, and "Replace w/Masters".
  1. Set up "Batch Convert and Save" function (under Edit): Get names of all FITS from /Uncalibrated folder, check the Calibration box, set Destination to /Calibrated folder, click OK. Now your calibrated FITS files (unfortunately with MaxIm's alternate extension .fit) are saved and ready. Go back to R.

**Input.R (post-calibration)______________________________________________**

 1. **finishFITS()**  ---  Resets calibrated FITS file extensions to .fts. Deletes all non-master files from /CalibrationMasters, verifies via each FITS header that all calibrations happened OK, greatly cleans up directory structure.
 1. **make_df_master()**  ---  Prepares inputs for and invokes APT software to build R data frame suitable for later use in photometric model building and AAVSO. APT is a bit limited in its aperture math, and I may later write my own aperture math in R, but for now APT is very reliable in its star marking in images. This function draws heavily on previously prepared FOV (field-of-view), one text file per field of view, which roughly corresponds to a VPhot "sequence" (badly named by AAVSO) of all the relevant target, check, and standard comp stars; my FOV file includes some additional metadata that might as well be bundled with the VPhot data, right in the same files.
**df_master** is the first immutable data frame; it is saved in the AN folder's "Photometry" subfolder. Once set up it should not be changed. This is not hard, as it is automated and hard to make a mistake in the steps constructing it. If it is changed, *all* steps below (Model.R & Predict.R) simply have to be rerun.

**Model.R_____________________________________________________________**

 1. **modelOneFilter()**  ---  Run once for each filter with observations of both comp stars and target stars. Preforms a mixed-model regression for one filter, and writes an empty template omit.txt file. The model uses all eligible comp stars, especially those with minimum signal-to-noise ratio and that are not saturated *in the original FITS image*. This function returns a one-filter model list for the entire Astronight. This one-filter model list will be compounded into a masterModelList once all filters have been modeled. The masterModelList includes all data that later will be needed to predict check-star and target-star magnitudes, plus all the other data required for an AAVSO report. 
 2. **omitSerial()** --- Adds #OBS lines to omit.txt so that observations with the specified Serial numbers are no longer used in model building. Model building is frequently an iterative process--model, plot, omit, and repeat--done independently in each filter.

**Plots.R ___________________________________________________________**

1. **modelPlots()** -- Writes a large number of ggplot2 diagnostic plots of model into RStudio's plot window. I use these to identify anything I want to omit from the model input--single observations (one comp star in one image, by Serial number), individual images, or all instances of a comp star either in one filter or in all filters. The user can specify these omissions by editing omit.txt directly, or sometimes more conveniently when omitting individual observations, by running omitSerial().
1. **[Later, we will also need some diagnostic plots for selecting/combining Target results for building
our AAVSO reports.]**

**Predict.R ______________________________________________________________**

 1. **predictAll()**  ---  Takes the final masterModelList and (1) makes predictions of target and check-star
 1. **writeAAVSO()**  ---  [in development. will need to draw on a LOT of metadata, but this should be available from outputs of the above, previously executed functions].
